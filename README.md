## Dev

To install the dependencies for the root project, as well as for the frontend and the backend, navigate to the root folder and execute:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

To run the project in development mode, navigate to the root folder and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses concurrency to start both the backend and frontend simultaneously.
